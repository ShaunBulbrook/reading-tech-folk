      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a group of individuals seeking conversations about tech and all
        the subjects surrounding it. If that sounds like you, you’ll fit in
        well! <em>All</em> are welcome.
      </p>
      <h2>Our event “format”</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>19:00 - 21:00</strong><br />
        Conversation time! Post-its and pens are provided, use them however you
        feel is best.
      </p>
      <p>We find topics and debates where we can all learn and contribute!</p>
      <p>
        <strong>21:00 - late</strong><br />After the main event, some of us go
        find a pub and have a social catchup over drinks. Sometimes games,
        sometimes just good company.
